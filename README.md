# JavaScript-Array-and-Functions
A lite Introduction to Arrays and functions in JavaScript Language

# JavaScript Arrays
Arrays are the Data Structures that lets you store a fixed size sequential collection of multiple values of either same type (Homogeneous Arrays) or of different types (Heterogeneous Array).

Arrays in JavaScript are Heterogenous and enables the programmer to store multiple types of elements in a single array. Furthermore, Arrays are the special type of "Objects". The basic difference between Arrays and Objects is that, Arrays have **Numbered Indexes** and Objects have **Named Indexes**.

# JavaScript Functions
Generally speaking, a function is a "subprogram" that can be called by code external (or internal in the case of recursion) to the function. Like the program itself, a function is composed of a sequence of statements called the function body. Values can be passed to a function, and the function will return a value.

In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, because they can have properties and methods just like any other object. What distinguishes them from other objects is that functions can be called. In brief, they are Function objects.
