# JavaScript Arrays
Arrays are the Data Structures that lets you store a fixed size sequential collection of multiple values of either same type (Homogeneous Arrays) or of different types (Heterogeneous Array).

Arrays in JavaScript are Heterogenous and enables the programmer to store multiple types of elements in a single array. Furthermore, Arrays are the special type of "Objects". The basic difference between Arrays and Objects is that, Arrays have **Numbered Indexes** and Objects have **Named Indexes**.
